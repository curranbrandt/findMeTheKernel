# Hello

Implemented start & stop modules that are compiled into one object file, start_stop.o

Implemented hello_params.c, which takes in i, in order to iterate through 2 arrays. One of these arrays you can overwrite by passing in a new array as a parameter when you insert the kerne module

Also what does dn=?
